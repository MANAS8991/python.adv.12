    "Using the += operator to concatenate strings does not violate Python's string immutability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the += operator for strings is implemented in a way that creates a new string object behind the scenes. It does not modify the original string in place but rather creates a new string by concatenating the operands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate this behavior:\n",

    "print(my_string)  # Output: Hello World\n",

    "\n",
    "This behavior ensures that the original string remains immutable, as it cannot be changed after creation. The += operator for strings provides a convenient way to concatenate strings while adhering to the principle of string immutability.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that while the += operator does not violate string immutability, it may create a new string object each time it is used, which can have performance implications when concatenating multiple strings in a loop. In such cases, using techniques like join() method or a list comprehension followed by ''.join() can be more efficient."
